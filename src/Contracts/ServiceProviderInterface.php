/**
 * Represents a component responsible for class registration in the Container.
 *
 * The goal of service providers is to centralize and organize in one place
 * registration of classes bound by any logic or classes with complex dependencies.
 *
 * You can simply organize registration of service and it's dependencies in a single
 * provider class except of creating bootstrap file or configuration array for the Container.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```php
 * class CarProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
 * {
 *    public function register(Container $container): void
 *    {
 *        $this->registerDependencies($container);
 *        $this->registerService($container);
 *    }
 *
 *    protected function registerDependencies($container): void
 *    {
 *        $container->set(EngineInterface::class, SolarEngine::class);
 *        $container->set(WheelInterface::class, [
 *            'class' => Wheel::class,
 *            '@color' => 'black',
 *        ]);
 *    }
 *
 *    protected function registerService($container): void
 *    {
 *        $container->set(Car::class, [
 *              'class' => Car::class,
 *              '@color' => 'red',
 *        ]);
 *    }
 * }
 * ```

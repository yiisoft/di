/**
 * Represents a component responsible for class registration in the Container.
 *
 * The goal of service providers is to centralize and organize in one place
 * registration of classes bound by any logic or classes with complex dependencies.
 *
 * You can simply organize registration of a service and its dependencies in a single
 * provider class except of creating bootstrap file or configuration array for the Container.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```php
 * class CarProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
 * {
 *    public function getDefinitions(): array
 *    {
 *        return [
 *            'car' =>  ['class' => Car::class],
 *            'car-factory' => CarFactory::class,
 *            EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
 *        ];
 *    }
 * }
 * ```

     *

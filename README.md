[PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible
[dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) container that is able to instantiate
and configure classes resolving dependencies.

## Features

- [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible.
- Supports property injection, constructor injection and method injection.
- Detects circular references.
- Accepts array definitions. Could be used with mergeable configs.
- Provides optional autoload fallback for classes without explicit definition.
- Allows delegated lookup and has composite container.
- Supports aliasing.
- Supports service providers.
- Has state resetter for long-running workers serving multiple requests such as [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)
  or [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/).
- Supports container delegates.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher.
- `Multibyte String` PHP extension.

## Installation

The package could be installed with composer:

```shell
composer require yiisoft/di --prefer-dist
```

## Using the container

Usage of the DI container is fairly simple: You first initialize it with an
array of *definitions*. The array keys are usually interface names. It will
then use these definitions to create an object whenever that type is requested.
This happens for example when fetching a type directly from the container
somewhere in the application. But objects are also created implicitly if a
definition has a dependency to another definition.

Usually a single container is used for the whole application. It is often
configured either in the entry script such as `index.php` or a configuration
file:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions($definitions);

$container = new Container($config);
```

The definitions could be stored in a `.php` file that returns an array:

```php
return [
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
    'full_definition' => [
        'class' => EngineMarkOne::class,
        '__construct()' => [42], 
        '$propertyName' => 'value',
        'setX()' => [42],
    ],
    'closure' => fn (SomeFactory $factory) => $factory->create('args'),
    'static_call_preferred' => fn () => MyFactory::create('args'),
    'static_call_supported' => [MyFactory::class, 'create'],
    'object' => new MyClass(),
];
```

As seen above an object can be defined in several ways:

 * In the simple case an interface definition maps an id to a particular class.
 * A full definition describes how to instantiate a class in more detail:
   * `class` contains the name of the class to be instantiated.
   * `__construct()` holds an array of constructor arguments.
   * The rest of the config are property values (prefixed with `$`) and method calls, postfixed with `()`. They are
     set/called in the order they appear in the array.
 * Closures are useful if instantiation is tricky and can better be described in code. When using these, arguments are
   auto-wired by type. `ContainerInterface` could be used to get current container instance.
 * If it is even more complicated, it is a good idea to move such code into a
   factory and reference it as a static call.
 * While it is usually not a good idea, you can also set an already
   instantiated object into the container.

See [yiisoft/definitions](https://github.com/yiisoft/definitions) for more information.

After the container is configured, a service can be obtained via `get()`:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Di\Container $container */
$object = $container->get('interface_name');
```

Note, however, that it is bad practice using a container directly. It is much
better to rely on autowiring as provided by the Injector available from the
[yiisoft/injector](https://github.com/yiisoft/injector) package.


## Using aliases

The DI container supports aliases via the
`Yiisoft\Definitions\Reference` class. This way objects can also be
retrieved by a more handy name:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
        'engine_one' => EngineInterface::class,
    ]);

$container = new Container($config);
$object = $container->get('engine_one');
```

## Composite containers

A composite container combines multiple containers in a single container. When
using this approach, objects should only be fetched from the composite
container.

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\CompositeContainer;
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$composite = new CompositeContainer();

$carConfig = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
        CarInterface::class => Car::class
    ]);
$carContainer = new Container($carConfig);

$bikeConfig = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        BikeInterface::class => Bike::class
    ]);

$bikeContainer = new Container($bikeConfig);
$composite->attach($carContainer);
$composite->attach($bikeContainer);

// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `Bike` class.
$bike = $composite->get(BikeInterface::class);
```

Note, that containers attached earlier override dependencies of containers attached later.

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\CompositeContainer;
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$carConfig = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
        CarInterface::class => Car::class
    ]);

$carContainer = new Container($carConfig);

$composite = new CompositeContainer();
$composite->attach($carContainer);

// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `EngineMarkOne` class.
$engine = $car->getEngine();

$engineConfig = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkTwo::class,
    ]);

$engineContainer = new Container($engineConfig);

$composite = new CompositeContainer();
$composite->attach($engineContainer);
$composite->attach($carContainer);

// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `EngineMarkTwo` class.
$engine = $composite->get(EngineInterface::class);
```

## Using service providers

A service provider is a special class that is responsible for providing complex
services or groups of dependencies for the container and extensions of existing services. 

A provider should extend from `Yiisoft\Di\ServiceProviderInterface` and must
contain a `getDefinitions()` and `getExtensions()` methods. It should only provide services for the container
and therefore should only contain code that is related to this task. It should *never*
implement any business logic or other functionality such as environment bootstrap or applying changes to database.

A typical service provider could look like:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ServiceProviderInterface;

class CarFactoryProvider extends ServiceProviderInterface
{
    public function getDefinitions(): array
    {
        return [
            CarFactory::class => [
                'class' => CarFactory::class,
                '$color' => 'red',
            ], 
            EngineInterface::class => SolarEngine::class,
            WheelInterface::class => [
                'class' => Wheel::class,
                '$color' => 'black',
            ],
            CarInterface::class => [
                'class' => BMW::class,
                '$model' => 'X5',
            ],
        ];    
    }
     
    public function getExtensions(): array
    {
        return [
            // Note that Garage should already be defined in container 
            Garage::class => function(ContainerInterface $container, Garage $garage) {
                $car = $container
                    ->get(CarFactory::class)
                    ->create();
                $garage->setCar($car);
                
                return $garage;
            }
        ];
    } 
}
```

Here we created a service provider responsible for bootstrapping of a car factory with all its dependencies.

An extension is a callable that returns a modified service object. In our case we get existing `Garage` service
and put a car into the garage by calling the method `setCar()`. Thus, before applying this provider, we had 
an empty garage and with the help of the extension we fill it.

To add this service provider to a container you can pass either its class or a
configuration array in the additional config:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withProviders([CarFactoryProvider::class]);

$container = new Container($config);
```

When a service provider is added, its `getDefinitions()` and `getExtensions()` methods are called
*immediately* both services and their extensions get registered into the container.

## Container tags

You can tag services in the following way:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([  
        BlueCarService::class => [
            'class' => BlueCarService::class,
            'tags' => ['car'], 
        ],
        RedCarService::class => [
            'definition' => fn () => new RedCarService(),
            'tags' => ['car'],
        ],
    ]);

$container = new Container($config);
```

Now we can get tagged services from the container in the following way:

```php
$container->get('tag@car');
```

The result is an array that contains two instances: `BlueCarService` and `RedCarService`.

Another way to tag services is setting tags via container constructor:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([  
        BlueCarService::class => [
            'class' => BlueCarService::class,
        ],
        RedCarService::class => fn () => new RedCarService(),
    ])
    ->withTags([
        // "car" tag has references to both blue and red cars
        'car' => [BlueCarService::class, RedCarService::class]
    ]);

$container = new Container($config);
```

## Resetting services state

Despite stateful services is not a great practice, these are inevitable in many cases. When you build long-running
applications with tools like [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) or [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/) you should
reset the state of such services every request. For this purpose you can use `StateResetter` with resetters callbacks:

```php
$resetter = new StateResetter();
$resetter->setResetters([
    MyServiceInterface::class => function () {
        $this->reset(); // a method of MyServiceInterface
    },
]);
```

The callback has access to the private and protected properties of the service instance, so you can set initial state
of the service efficiently without creating a new instance. 

The reset itself should be triggered after each request-response cycle. For RoadRunner it would look like the following:

```php
while ($request = $psr7->acceptRequest()) {
    $response = $application->handle($request);
    $psr7->respond($response);
    $application->afterEmit($response);
    $container
        ->get(\Yiisoft\Di\StateResetter::class)
        ->reset();
    gc_collect_cycles();
}
```

### Setting resetters in definitions 

Reset state is defined for each individual service by providing "reset" callback in the following way:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDefinitions([
        EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
        EngineMarkOne::class => [
            'class' => EngineMarkOne::class,
            'setNumber()' => [42],
            'reset' => function () {
                $this->number = 42;
            },
        ],
    ]);

$container = new Container($config);
```

Note: resetters from definitons work only if you don't set `StateResetter` in definition or service providers.

### Configuring `StateResetter` manually

To manually add resetters or in case you use Yii DI composite container with a third party container that does
not support state reset natively, state resetter could be configured separately. The following example is PHP-DI:

```php
MyServiceInterface::class => function () {
    // ...
},
StateResetter::class => function () {
    $resetter = new StateResetter();
    $resetter->setResetters([
        MyServiceInterface::class => function () {
            $this->reset(); // a method of MyServiceInterface
        },
    ]);
    return $resetter;
}
```

## Specifying metadata for non-array definitions

In order to specify some metadata, such as in cases of "resetting services state" or "container tags" above, for non-array
definitions, the following syntax could be used:

```php
LogTarget::class => [
    'definition' => static function (LoggerInterface $logger) use ($params) {
        $target = ...
        return $target;
    },
    'reset' => function () use ($params) {
        ...
    },
],
```

In the above we have explicitly moved definition itself to "definition" key.

## Delegates

Container delegates define. Each delegate is a callable returning a container instance that is used in case a service
can not be found in primary container:

```php
function (ContainerInterface $container): ContainerInterface
{

}
```

In order to configure delegates use additional config:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withDelegates([
        function (ContainerInterface $container): ContainerInterface {
            // ...
        }
    ]);


$container = new Container($config);
```

## Tuning for production

By default, the container validates definitions right when they are set. In production environment, it makes sense to
turn it off:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withValidate(false);

$container = new Container($config);
```

## Strict mode

Container may work in strict mode, i.e. when everything in the container should be defined explicitly. In order to
turn it on use the following code:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\ContainerConfig;

$config = ContainerConfig::create()
    ->withStrictMode(true);

$container = new Container($config);
```

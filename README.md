## Features

- [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible.
- Supports property injection, constructor injection and method injection.
- Detects circular references.
- Accepts array definitions. Could be used with mergeable configs.
- Provides autoload fallback for classes without explicit definition.
- Allows delegated lookup and has composite container.
- Supports aliasing.
- Supports service providers and deferred service providers.


## Using the container

Usage of the DI container is fairly simple: You first initialize it with an
array of *definitions*. The array keys are usually interface names. It will
then use these definitions to create an object whenever that type is requested.
This happens for example when fetching a type directly from the container
somewhere in the application. But objects are also created implicitly if a
definition has a dependency to another definition.

Usually a single container is used for the whole application. It is often
configured either in the entry script such as `index.php` or a configuration
file:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;

$container = new Container($config);
```

The configuration can be stored in a `.php` file that returns an array:

```php
return [
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
    'full_definition' => [
        'class' => EngineMarkOne::class,
        '__construct()' => [42], 
        '@propertyName' => 'value',
        'setX()' => [42],
    ],
    'closure' => fn (SomeFactory $factory) => $factory->create('args'),
    'static_call_preferred' => fn () => MyFactory::create('args'),
    'static_call_supported' => [MyFactory::class, 'create'],
    'object' => new MyClass(),
];
```

As seen above an object can be defined in several ways:

 * In the simple case an interface definition maps an id to a particular class.
 * A full definition describes how to instantiate a class in more detail:
   * `class` contains the name of the class to be instantiated.
   * `__construct()` holds an array of constructor arguments.
   * The rest of the config are property values (prefixed with `@`) and method calls, postfixed with `()`. They are
     set/called in the order they appear in the array.
 * Closures are useful if instantiation is tricky and can better be described in code.
 * If it is even more complicated, it is a good idea to move such code into a
   factory and reference it as a static call.
 * While it is usually not a good idea, you can also set an already
   instantiated object into the container.

After the container is configured, dependencies can be obtained via `get()`:

```php
/** @var \Yiisoft\Di\Container $container */
$object = $container->get('interface_name');
```

Note, however, that it is bad practice using a container directly. It is much
better to rely on autowiring as provided by the Injector available from the
[yiisoft/injector](https://github.com/yiisoft/injector) package.


## Using aliases

The DI container supports aliases via the
`Yiisoft\Factory\Definition\Reference` class. This way objects can also be
retrieved by a more handy name:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;

$container = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
    'engine_one' => EngineInterface::class,
]);
$object = $container->get('engine_one');
```

## Delegated lookups and composite containers

Another feature of the `Container` class are *delegated lookups*. This means
that *all* dependencies for definitions in the container should be resolved via
a *root container* - and not by the container itself.

To use delegated lookups a root container can be passed as third argument to
the constructor:

```php
class Car
{
    private EngineInterface $engine;

    public function __construct(EngineInterface $engine)
    {
        $this->engine = $engine;
    }

    public function getEngine(): EngineInterface
    {
        return $this->engine;
    }
}

$rootContainer = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkTwo::class
]);
$container = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
], [], $rootContainer);

// returns an instance of `Car`
$car = $container->get(Car::class);
// returns an instance of `EngineMarkTwo`
$engine = $car->getEngine();
```

Note, that the root container is only used for resolving dependencies. You can
not directly fetch entries of the root container from the container via `get()`.

Delegated lookups are mainly useful for composite containers.


### Composite containers

A composite container combines multiple containers in a single container. When
using this approach, objects should only be fetched from the composite
container.

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\CompositeContainer;
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;

$composite = new CompositeContainer();
$carContainer = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
    CarInterface::class => Car::class
], []);
$bikeContainer = new Container([
    BikeInterface::class => Bike::class
], []);
$composite->attach($carContainer);
$composite->attach($bikeContainer);

// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `Bike` class.
$bike = $composite->get(BikeInterface::class);
```

Note, that containers attached later override dependencies of containers attached earlier.

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\CompositeContainer;
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;

$composite = new CompositeContainer();
$carContainer = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkOne::class,
    CarInterface::class => Car::class
], []);
$composite->attach($carContainer);

// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `EngineMarkOne` class.
$engine = $car->getEngine();

$engineContainer = new Container([
    EngineInterface::class => EngineMarkTwo::class,
], []);
$composite->attach($engineContainer);
// Returns an instance of a `Car` class.
$car = $composite->get(CarInterface::class);
// Returns an instance of a `EngineMarkTwo` class.
$engine = $composite->get(EngineInterface::class);
```

## Contextual containers

In an application there are several levels at which we might want to have configuration for the DI container.
For example, in a Yii application these could be:

- An extension providing default configuration
- An application with configuration
- A module inside the application that uses different configuration than the main application

While in general you never want to inject DI containers into your objects, there are some exceptions such as
Yii application modules that need access to the container.

To support this use case while still supporting custom configuration at the module level we have implemented contextual containers.
The main class is `CompositeContextContainer`. It is like a `CompositeContainer` in the sense that it doesn't contain any definitions.
The `attach()` function of the contextual container has an extra string parameter defining the context of the container.

Using this context we can create a simple scoping system:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\CompositeContextContainer;

$composite = new CompositeContextContainer();
$coreContainer = new Container([], []);
$extensionContainer = new Container([], []);

$appContainer = new Container([
    LoggerInterface::class => MainLogger::class
], []);
$moduleAContainer = new Container([
    LoggerInterface::class => LoggerA::class
], []);
$moduleBContainer = new Container([
    LoggerInterface::class => LoggerB::class
], []);

$composite->attach($moduleAContainer, '/moduleA');
$composite->attach($moduleBContainer, '/moduleB');
$composite->attach($appContainer);
$composite->attach($extensionContainer);
$composite->attach($coreContainer);

// The composite context container will allow us to create contextual containers with virtually no overhead.
$moduleAContainer = $composite->getContextContainer('/moduleA');
$moduleBContainer = $composite->getContextContainer('/moduleB');

$composite->get(LoggerInterface::class); // MainLogger
$moduleAContainer->get(LoggerInterface::class); // LoggerA
$moduleBContainer->get(LoggerInterface::class); // LoggerB
```

Searching is done using the longest prefix first and then checking the containers in the order in which they were added.
In the case of Yii contextual containers for the modules are created automatically.


## Using service providers

A service provider is a special class that is responsible for binding complex
services or groups of dependencies into the container. This includes
registering services with its references, event listeners, middleware etc.

Service providers extend from `Yiisoft\Di\Support\ServiceProvider` and must
contain a `register()` method. It should only bind things into the container
and therefore only contain code that is related to this task. It should *never*
implement any business logic or other functionality like environment bootstrap
or DB changes.

To access the container in a service provider you should use the `$container` argument.

A typical service provider could look like:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\Support\ServiceProvider;

class CarFactoryProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(Container $container): void
    {
        $this->registerDependencies($container);
        $this->registerService($container);
    }

    protected function registerDependencies(Container $container): void
    {
        $container->set(EngineInterface::class, SolarEngine::class);
        $container->set(WheelInterface::class, [
            'class' => Wheel::class,
            '@color' => 'black',
        ]);
        $container->set(CarInterface::class, [
            'class' => BMW::class,
            '@model' => 'X5',
        ]);
    }

    protected function registerService(Container $container): void
    {
        $container->set(CarFactory::class, [
              'class' => CarFactory::class,
              '@color' => 'red',
        ]);
    }
}
```
Here we created a service provider responsible for bootstrapping of a car
factory with all its dependencies.

To add this service provider to a container you can pass either its class or a
configuration array in the `$providers` constructor parameter:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;

$container = new Container($config, [
    CarFactoryProvider::class,
]);
```

When a service provider is added, its `register()` method is called
*immediately* and services get registered into the container.

Thus service providers might *decrease* the performance of your
application if you perform heavy operations inside the `register()` method.


## Using deferred service providers

To prevent the potential performance decrease when using service providers you
can use so-called *deferred service providers*.

They extend from `Yiisoft\Di\Support\DeferredServiceProvider` and must
implement an additional `provides()` method (besides `register()`). This method
returns an array with names and identifiers of services that the service
provider binds to the container.

Deferred service providers are added to a container just like regular service
providers. But the `register()` method is only called when one of the services
listed in `provides()` is requested from the container.

Here's an example:

```php
use Yiisoft\Di\Container;
use Yiisoft\Di\Support\DeferredServiceProvider;

class CarFactoryProvider extends DeferredServiceProvider
{
    public function provides(): array
    {
        return [
            CarFactory::class,
            CarInterface::class,
            EngineInterface::class,
            WheelInterface::class,
        ];
    }

    public function register(Container $container): void
    {
        $this->registerDependencies($container);
        $this->registerService($container);
    }

    protected function registerDependencies(Container $container): void
    {
        $container->set(EngineInterface::class, SolarEngine::class);
        $container->set(WheelInterface::class, [
            'class' => Wheel::class,
            '@color' => 'black',
        ]);
        $container->set(CarInterface::class, [
            'class' => BMW::class,
            '@model' => 'X5',
        ]);
    }

    protected function registerService(Container $container): void
    {
        $container->set(CarFactory::class, [
              'class' => CarFactory::class,
              '@color' => 'red',
        ]);
    }
}

$container = new Container($config, [CarFactoryProvider::class]);

// returns false as provider wasn't registered
$container->has(EngineInterface::class); 

// returns SolarEngine, registered in the provider
$engine = $container->get(EngineInterface::class); 

// returns true as provider was registered when EngineInterface was requested from the container
$container->has(EngineInterface::class); 
```

In the code above we add a `CarFactoryProvider` to the container. The
`register()` method of `CarFactoryProvider` isn't executed until
`EngineInterface` gets requested from the container. When this happens,
the container will first check the result of the `provides()` method.
Because `EngineInterface` is listed there it will then call the `register()`
method of the `CarFactoryProvider`.
